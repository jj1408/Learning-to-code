<p>As Birtish Summer Time slipped away and the turn of Autumn was upon us, a bit of Southern France sun was just what the doctor ordered. An early start at a misty Stanstead Airport did not dampen the spirits and after what has become my traditional pre-holiday wetherspoons breakfast and an I don't care what time of day it is pint, we were on our way.</p>
<p>An uneventful flight flew by (excuse the pun) with a little help from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling">J.K. Rowling </a>and before we knew it we were in Marseille. Not without a couple of hiccups with the car hire (which meant <a href="mailto:lukejackson444@hotmail.com">Luke</a> and Marg got to enjoy the first spot of sunbathing in the airport car park) we were soon on our way to our 
<a href="www.airbnb.co.uk/">Airbnb.</a>
</p>
<p>It was a short drive to the villa allowed which us to take in some of the sights of Marseille, and after some awkward coversations in broken French (and Spanish) we were free to settle in to our home for the week. The villa was beatiful and set in the mountains just outside a small port town called <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/13600+La+Ciotat,+France/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x12c9af63ace8b8e5:0x40819a5fd9703d0?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij7NjkzL_PAhULVhQKHai2APkQ8gEIjQEwDg" target="blank">La Ciotat.</a></p>
<h3>A lazy first day</h3>
<p>Once settled it was apparent that the early flight had taken it's toll. This clearly meant a day of lounging around the pool, which quickly lead to beer pong in the pool, which lead to my greatest architectural acheivment of all time....</p>

<p>OK it's no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave">Gustave Eiffel</a>, but not bad for a guy with a Media degree</p>
<h3>Pascal</h3>
<p>To our delight on the first evening we got a visit from the resident cat. Unfortunatley no pictures to show he exists as he seemed quite non-plussed by thew whole afair, but Pascal as he came to be known seemed to warm to us as the week went on. All thefood we gave him probably helped. Who says cats aren't fickle</p>

<p>On the third day of our idyllic break we took a short drive to a beautiful port town called Cassis. The quaint harbour was stunning and the lighthouse that disected it gave us an opportunity for a bit of a swim. Getting in the water seemed more of a challenge to some than others but eventually Laura and I were in the rather fresh water swimming accross to the rocks the other side for a spot of rock jumping. The video may not do it justice but I can assure you that the rock was incredibly high...</p>
